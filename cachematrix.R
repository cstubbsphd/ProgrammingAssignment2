## Set of functions that calculate matrix inverses.  Previously calculated 
## inverses are cached so they do not have to be recalculated (memoization)

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
